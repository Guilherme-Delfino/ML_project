# ML_project

Authors: Domink Vuina and Guilherme Delfino, May 2022

This is our work submitted as the Final Project for the course PY 580 Machine Learning for Physicists.
The course was ministred in Spring 2022 at Boston University by the Prof. Pankaj Mehta, PhD.

The work is an attempt to reproduce the results in the work ArXiv:1711.00020.
We wanted to study how machine learnining techniques can be applied in the context of Condensed Matter Theory and MBL.

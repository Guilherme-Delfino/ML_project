# ML_project

Authors: Domink Vuina and Guilherme Delfino, May 2022

This is our work submitted as the Final Project for the course PY 580 Machine Learning for Physicists.
The course was ministred in Spring 2022 at Boston University by the Prof. Pankaj Mehta, PhD.

The work is an attempt to reproduce the results in the work ArXiv:1711.00020.
We wanted to study how machine learnining techniques can be applied in the context of Condensed Matter Theory and MBL.

-See files Training_data and Test_data for the generation of the data through ED (QuSpin). The first is responsible for the data we train the model and the second for the data we use to predict (transfer learning).
-See file ML model for transfer learning with N=1 and N=10 and ML model1 for N=30
